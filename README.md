Over the last week I've been taking a crash course on PHP to continue improving my skillset. 
The course is a 3+ hour video tutorial offered by Traversy Media.
The first section covers basic programming and syntax in PHP.
The second section is a practice back-end setup for an app.

This code is a mix of my own notes and pasted code from the course repo.
